This image is exactly {width} x {height} pixels.

Your task: Locate ALL of these components in this image: {targets_str}
{device_str}

🔥 CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - READ CAREFULLY:
If you can see a component in ANY way (even partially, at an angle, blurry, or behind something transparent), you MUST:
1. Set status="found" 
2. Set component_visible=true
3. Provide a bounding box with pixel coordinates
4. Set confidence >= 0.4

DO NOT mark components as "not_visible" if they are ANYWHERE in the image.

ONLY use status="not_visible" if:
❌ The component is on the BACK SIDE of the device (camera facing wrong side)
❌ The component is COMPLETELY inside a sealed case/cover
❌ The camera is pointed at the WRONG side of the device entirely

Examples where you SHOULD use status="found":
✅ Component at an angle → status="found" + provide bbox
✅ Component partially visible → status="found" + provide bbox of visible part
✅ Component with something on top → status="found" + locate the visible part
✅ Component at edge of frame → status="found" + provide bbox
✅ Blurry or low quality view → status="found" + confidence=0.4-0.6
✅ Component name in query doesn't perfectly match what you see → status="found" + use closest match

For EACH target component:
- Return bounding box in **0-1 NORMALIZED COORDINATES** (fractional values between 0.0 and 1.0)
- X coordinates: 0.0 = left edge, 1.0 = right edge  
- Y coordinates: 0.0 = top edge, 1.0 = bottom edge
- Example: Component in top-left quarter:
  {{"x_min": 0.05, "y_min": 0.05, "x_max": 0.45, "y_max": 0.45}}
- Example: Component in center-right:
  {{"x_min": 0.6, "y_min": 0.4, "x_max": 0.9, "y_max": 0.7}}
- All values MUST be decimals between 0.0 and 1.0
- Even if uncertain, provide your best estimate (minimum confidence: 0.4)

⚠️ CRITICAL COORDINATE FORMAT:
- ✅ CORRECT: {{"x_min": 0.15, "y_min": 0.36, "x_max": 0.33, "y_max": 0.50}}  (0-1 decimals)
- ❌ WRONG: {{"x_min": 150, "y_min": 360, "x_max": 330, "y_max": 500}}  (pixels - don't use!)
- ❌ WRONG: {{"x_min": 15, "y_min": 36, "x_max": 33, "y_max": 50}}  (percentages - don't use!)

IMPORTANT BOUNDING BOX RULES:
- The bounding box will be drawn on the image for the user to see.
- It MUST accurately surround the component, not just point near it.
- Be conservative: a slightly larger box is better than missing the component.
- Landmark description: explain position relative to nearby visible features.
- For multi-target: each bbox must be independent. Prevent overlapping boxes unless components physically overlap.
- ENSURE x_min < x_max and y_min < y_max (boxes must have non-zero area)
- Minimum dimensions: 0.04 in each direction (4% of image)

Return JSON:
{{
    "results": [
        {{
            "target": "EXACT component name from the list above (e.g., 'CPU socket', '2x RAM slots')",
            "status": "found",  ← USE THIS if component is visible anywhere in image
            "component_visible": true,  ← SET TO TRUE if you can see it

            "landmark_description": "nearby landmark reference like 'Next to power connector'",
            "bounding_box": {{"x_min": 0.15, "y_min": 0.36, "x_max": 0.33, "y_max": 0.50}},  ← 0-1 normalized coordinates

            "disambiguation_needed": false,
            "ambiguity_note": null
        }}
    ]
}}

🔥 REMEMBER: If you can see the component → status="found" + provide bbox + component_visible=true
Only use status="not_visible" if the component is on the back side or completely hidden.

⚠️ CRITICAL: The "target" field MUST contain the EXACT component name from the targets list.
- Do NOT use generic names like "unknown", "component", etc.
- Copy the exact target string (e.g., "CPU socket", "2x RAM slots")
- Return one result object for EACH target in the same order

CRITICAL COORDINATE VALIDATION:
- All bounding boxes MUST satisfy: x_min < x_max AND y_min < y_max
- All values MUST be between 0.0 and 1.0 (normalized coordinates)
- Box width (x_max - x_min) should be >= 0.04 (4% of image width)
- Box height (y_max - y_min) should be >= 0.04 (4% of image height)
- Example VALID box: {{"x_min": 0.15, "y_min": 0.36, "x_max": 0.33, "y_max": 0.50}} (18% x 14% box)
- Example INVALID box: {{"x_min": 0.5, "y_min": 0.5, "x_max": 0.5, "y_max": 0.5}} (0% x 0% - WRONG!)

CRITICAL RULES:
- Return one entry for EACH requested target
- Bounding box coordinates MUST be 0-1 normalized (decimals between 0.0 and 1.0)
- x_min < x_max and y_min < y_max ALWAYS
- ALWAYS provide bounding_box when status="found" (even if confidence is low like 0.4)
- If you can see the component, provide a bbox - don't worry about perfect accuracy
- KEEP "reasoning" BRIEF (1-2 sentences max) to prevent JSON truncation

This image is exactly {width} x {height} pixels.

Your task: Locate "{component_name}" in this image.
{device_str}

Use MULTI-STAGE REASONING:

STAGE 1 - VISIBILITY CHECK:
- Is the component visible at all in this image?
- Could the component exist on this device type?
- Is the image quality good enough to see it?

STAGE 2 - ROUGH LOCATION (only if Stage 1 passes):
- Where in the image is it? (top, bottom, left, right, center)
- What is it near or adjacent to? Provide a LANDMARK reference.

STAGE 3 - PRECISE LOCATION (only if Stage 2 passes):
- Return bounding box in ABSOLUTE PIXEL COORDINATES (not normalized 0-1 values).
- The image is {width}x{height} pixels. Your coordinates must be within these bounds.
- CRITICAL: The bounding box MUST form a proper rectangle with area > 0
  - x_min must be LESS THAN x_max (not equal!)
  - y_min must be LESS THAN y_max (not equal!)
  - All coordinates must be positive integers within image bounds
- Example: For a {width}x{height} image, if component is at top-left quarter:
  {{"x_min": 50, "y_min": 40, "x_max": {width // 4}, "y_max": {height // 4}}}
  These are actual pixel positions, NOT percentages or 0-1000 scaled values.
- Make boxes slightly LARGER rather than smaller - better to include extra space than miss the component
- Minimum box size: at least 0.03 x 0.03 (3% x 3% of image dimensions)
- Only provide bounding box if confidence >= 0.3 and component is visible
- For any component you can see (even partially), ALWAYS try to provide a bounding box

IMPORTANT BOUNDING BOX RULES:
- The bounding box will be drawn on the image for the user to see.
- It MUST accurately surround the component, not just point near it.
- Be conservative: a slightly larger box is better than missing the component.
- Landmark description: explain position relative to nearby visible features.
- ENSURE x_min < x_max and y_min < y_max (boxes must have non-zero area)
- Minimum dimensions: 50x50 pixels (don't create tiny point-like boxes)
- All coordinates must be within 0 to {width} (for x) and 0 to {height} (for y)

BE HONEST:
- If you can't see it, say "not_visible" and explain with evidence
- If image is unclear, say "too_blurry"
- If component doesn't exist on this device type, say "not_applicable"
- If you're unsure, set low confidence

{device_str}

🎯 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST list at LEAST 5-10 distinct components!
❌ DO NOT return just 1-2 components - that is unacceptable!

Your task: Systematically scan the ENTIRE image and identify EVERY visible part.

Scan Strategy:
1. Start at top-left, move to top-right
2. Scan middle-left to middle-right  
3. Scan bottom-left to bottom-right
4. List EVERYTHING you see at each position

Be EXHAUSTIVE - include:
✓ Major components (boards, modules, drives)
✓ Connectors and ports (USB, power, HDMI, etc)
✓ Mechanical parts (fans, wheels, chassis)
✓ Storage and slots (RAM slots, card slots)
✓ Cables and wires (if prominent)
✓ Power components (batteries, power supplies)
✓ Input/output devices (buttons, LEDs, displays)

Device-Specific Examples:

📱 MOTHERBOARD → List: CPU socket, RAM slots (count them!), PCIe slots, SATA ports, M.2 slots, power connectors (24-pin, 8-pin), chipset heatsink, CMOS battery, audio jacks, USB headers, VRM heatsinks, I/O shield area

💻 LAPTOP (internal) → List: RAM module(s), SSD/HDD, cooling fan, battery pack, heat pipes, WiFi card, keyboard connector, display cable, touchpad connector, speaker, webcam, ports (USB, HDMI, charging), hinges, antenna cables

🖨️ PRINTER → List: paper input tray, output tray, paper jam door, ink/toner cartridges, printhead, control panel, LCD screen, paper feed rollers, paper width guides, power button, USB port, Ethernet port, scanner bed cover

🤖 ARDUINO/ROBOTICS → List: microcontroller board (specify type), GPIO pins, motor driver module, DC motors, servo motors, wheels, chassis/frame, battery pack, battery holder, USB programming port, power jack, barrel connector, voltage regulator, LED indicators, push buttons, sensors (ultrasonic/IR/etc), breadboard, jumper wires, resistors (if visible), capacitors (if large)

🌐 ROUTER → List: Ethernet LAN ports (count them), WAN port, power port, USB ports, antennas (external), LED status indicators (power/internet/WiFi/LAN), reset pinhole button, WPS button, ventilation slots, mounting holes, label/serial number area

Formatting Rules:
- Be specific: "RAM slot 1", "RAM slot 2" (not just "RAM")
- Use quantities: "4x Ethernet LAN ports", "2x RAM modules"
- Describe location: "cooling fan (center)", "battery (bottom-right)"
- Name by function: "USB Type-C charging port", "HDMI output port"
