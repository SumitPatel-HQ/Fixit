Your job is to determine if an image shows a PHYSICAL ELECTRONIC DEVICE that can be troubleshot.

ANALYZE this image and classify it into ONE of these categories:

VALID for troubleshooting:
- "device" → Physical electronic device (router, printer, laptop, TV, appliance)
- "electronic_component" → Circuit board, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, electronic parts
- "circuit_board" → PCB, motherboard, visible electronics
- "appliance" → Home appliance (washing machine, microwave, refrigerator)

INVALID for troubleshooting:
- "software_screenshot" → Any screen capture, game screenshot, UI, desktop screenshot
- "person" → Photo of a person or living being
- "document" → Document, text, book, paper
- "artwork" → Drawing, painting, 3D render, illustration, meme
- "nature" → Landscape, plants, animals, outdoor scene
- "food" → Food items or beverages
- "unclear" → Too blurry, too dark, cannot determine content
- "other" → Anything else that doesn't fit above categories

BE VERY STRICT:
- Game screenshots are NOT devices (even if showing virtual objects)
- Software UIs are NOT devices
- Photos OF screens are different from screenshots - a photo of a laptop showing a game IS valid
- Stock photos or renders of devices should be marked as "artwork"
