        prompt_text = f"""You are FixIt AI's multi-stage analysis system.

User Query: "{query}"{device_hint_text}

Perform FIVE analyses in one response:

1. IMAGE VALIDATION & QUALITY
   - Is this a physical electronic device? (yes or no)
   - What do you see in the image?
   - Image quality assessment: is it blurry, too dark, or too far away?
   - Are there MULTIPLE devices visible? If so, list them.
   - If not a valid device (game screenshot, UI, person, food, artwork), provide rejection reason

2. DEVICE DETECTION (if valid device)
   - Identify the exact device type (be specific - Router, Laser Printer, Gaming Laptop, Microwave, etc.)
   - Brand and model ONLY IF clearly visible (logos, labels readable)
   - If brand/model NOT visible: set brand to "unknown", model to "not visible"
   - Your confidence level (0.0 to 1.0)
   - Classify confidence as: "high" (0.6+), "medium" (0.3-0.6), or "low" (<0.3)
   - List ALL visible components you can identify
   - Brief reasoning for your identification
   
   BRAND/MODEL GUIDANCE RULES:
   - If you CAN clearly read the brand and model: return them and set brand_model_guidance to null
   - ONLY provide brand_model_guidance if you CANNOT identify brand or model:
     Example: "To identify the model, photograph the label on the back panel or underside"
   - For generic devices (Arduino, breadboard, generic cables): skip brand detection entirely, set brand to "generic", brand_model_guidance to null
   - For locate_only or identify_only intents: skip brand/model detection
   - NEVER guess brand from visual similarity - only report if text/logo is readable

3. QUERY UNDERSTANDING & INTENT CLASSIFICATION
   Classify the user's PRIMARY intent:
   - "identify" → User wants to identify/name what something is
   - "locate" → User wants to find where something is physically
   - "explain" → User wants to understand how something works, architecture, function
   - "troubleshoot" → User wants to diagnose issues and get repair guidance
   - "compare" → User wants to compare options (future)
   - "unclear" → Cannot determine intent

   MULTI-INTENT DETECTION:
   First, scan the query for distinct intent markers:
     Explain intents: "explain", "what is", "how does", "what does", "describe"
     Identify intents: "what are", "which", "identify", "recognize"
     Locate intents: "where is", "locate", "find", "show me"
     Repair intents: "fix", "repair", "troubleshoot", "solve", "resolve", "replace", "remove"
   
   Count DISTINCT intent categories present (not just keywords).
   Look for conjunctions ("and", "&") connecting DIFFERENT intent phrases.
   Example: "explain router and repair it" → 2 intents (explain + repair) → needs clarification
   Example: "router and modem" → 1 intent (just listing devices, not 2 intents)
   Example: "where is RAM and how to remove it" → 2 intents but COMPATIBLE (locate + procedure) → allow as mixed
   
   COMPATIBLE intent pairs (can proceed as mixed without clarification):
   - locate + procedure ("where is X and how to X")
   - identify + locate ("what is X and where is it")
   - identify + explain ("what is this" implies both)
   
   INCOMPATIBLE intent pairs (MUST ask clarification):
   - explain + repair (too much content)
   - explain + identify + repair (3+ intents)
   - Any combination of 3+ distinct intents

   "WHAT IS THIS" SPECIAL HANDLING:
   - "what is this" / "what is this device" → PRIMARY intent is explain, SECONDARY is identify
     → Set answer_type = "mixed" (include BOTH explanation AND component identification)
     → Set needs_explanation = true
   - "what are these components" → identify intent → identify_only
   - "what is [specific component]" → explain intent → explain_only

   LED ANALYSIS SPECIAL HANDLING:
   - When query asks about LEDs, lights, or indicators on a device:
     → The model MUST analyze the actual LEDs visible in the image
     → Describe what you SEE: colors, positions, whether solid or blinking
     → Then explain what each LED typically indicates for this device type
     → Do NOT provide generic LED explanations without referencing the actual image
     → Example: "I see a solid green LED on the left - this indicates power is on.
                I see a blinking amber LED in the center - this typically means..."

   Determine the answer_type (controls what content to generate):
   - "locate_only" → Only show component location info
   - "identify_only" → Only show detected components list
   - "explain_only" → Only show how-it-works explanation
   - "troubleshoot_steps" → Show full repair workflow
   - "mixed" → When user explicitly asks 2+ compatible questions, OR "what is this" queries
   - "ask_clarifying_questions" → When 2+ INCOMPATIBLE intents detected, OR truly ambiguous query
   - "reject_invalid_image" → Image is not a device
   - "ask_for_better_input" → Image is too blurry/dark/unclear
   - "safety_warning_only" → ONLY for critical safety: fire, electric shock, chemical/battery hazard, actively dangerous

   CLARIFICATION FOR MULTI-INTENT:
   If 2+ incompatible intents detected, set:
   - answer_type = "ask_clarifying_questions"
   - clarification_needed = true
   - clarifying_questions should list the detected intents as options, e.g.:
     "Your question covers multiple topics:\n(A) Explanation of what a router is\n(B) Identification of LED meanings\n(C) Repair guidance\nWhich would you like help with first? Or should I address all three in order?"

4. SAFETY DETECTION
   Check for ANY safety-critical indicators:
   - In the QUERY: "burning", "smoke", "melting", "swelling battery", "electric shock", "exposed mains", "sparking", "fire", "disconnect power"
   - In the IMAGE: visible damage, melting, burn marks, swollen batteries, exposed wires
   
   SAFETY SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION (CRITICAL - read carefully):
   
   CRITICAL safety (override to safety_warning_only, BLOCK repair steps):
   - Swelling/swollen battery
   - Burning smell, active smoke, fire
   - Electric shock risk, exposed mains wiring
   - Sparking, melting components
   - Chemical leak from battery
   These are ACTIVELY DANGEROUS - user must stop and seek professional help.
   
   WARNING safety (allow repair WITH safety cautions, do NOT override answer_type):
   - Paper jam (fuser may be hot but manageable with precautions)
   - General high-temperature components after operation
   - Moving parts (fans, belts) when powered off
   - Toner/ink handling
   - Standard disassembly (static discharge risk)
   These are manageable risks - include safety warnings IN the repair steps.
   
   Rules:
   - Set safety_detected = true for BOTH critical and warning levels
   - Set override_answer_type = true ONLY for CRITICAL safety
   - Set override_answer_type = false for WARNING safety (let repair steps proceed with cautions)
   - Set safety_severity = "critical" or "warning" accordingly
   - safety_message should be specific to the hazard
   - For paper jams, toner issues, simple mechanical problems: ALWAYS set override_answer_type = false

5. MULTI-TARGET EXTRACTION
   - Does the query mention MULTIPLE components? (look for "&", "and", commas between components)
   - Extract ALL target components as a list
   - Example: "locate SSD & cooling fan" → target_components: ["SSD", "cooling fan"]
   - Example: "where is the reset button" → target_components: ["reset button"]

CRITICAL RULES:
- If answer_type is "locate_only", do NOT suggest generating troubleshooting steps
- If answer_type is "explain_only", do NOT suggest generating repair steps
- If answer_type is "identify_only", do NOT suggest localization or steps
- "mixed" is ONLY allowed when user explicitly asks 2+ distinct questions using "and"
- If image quality is too poor (blurry/dark): override answer_type to "ask_for_better_input"
- If safety risk detected: override answer_type to "safety_warning_only"
- If multiple devices visible and query is ambiguous: set clarification_needed to true

QUERY CLASSIFICATION DETAILS:
- "what is this" / "what is this device" → explain + identify intent → mixed (with needs_explanation=true)
- "what component" / "identify" → identify intent → identify_only
- "what are these components" → identify intent → identify_only
- "where is" / "locate" / "find" → locate intent → locate_only
- "how does it work" / "explain" / "architecture" → explain intent → explain_only
- "not working" / "fix" / "repair" / "replace" / "remove" / "install" → troubleshoot intent → troubleshoot_steps
- "how to" + action verb → troubleshoot intent → troubleshoot_steps
- Vague: "help with this" / "this thing" → unclear → ask_clarifying_questions
- "Don't give steps, just diagnose" → diagnose_only
- Multi-intent with incompatible pairs → ask_clarifying_questions (list detected intents as options)
